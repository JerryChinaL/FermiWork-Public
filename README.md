Improve resolution with LightGBM

The 200 and 2000 notebooks contain some early data explorations and visualizations.

data-prep generates clustered data, and saves them into files that are needed for LGB training.

LGB training is done in valset.ipynb. Essentially, only this file needs to be run. You can find the necessary data files in this Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w64OjJA48x3GsoZZP3_q90-wtlhHLh9e?usp=sharing
